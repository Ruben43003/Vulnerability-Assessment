# Vulnerability Assessment - Windows Server 2022

## Purpose
This project demonstrates the process of analyzing the security posture of a Windows Server 2022 instance deployed on AWS. It involves enabling Active Directory and DNS services on the server, conducting vulnerability scanning using Nessus from a virtual Kali Linux machine, and remediating critical vulnerabilities identified in the scan results.

## Vulnerablity Management Process

1. **Deployment of Windows Server 2022 on AWS:** 
   - A Windows Server 2022 instance was deployed on AWS.
   - Configuration was left as default.

2. **Configuration of Active Directory and DNS Services:**
   - Active Directory and DNS services were enabled on the server.

3. **Vulnerability Scanning Using Nessus:**
   - Nessus was used from a virtual Kali Linux machine to perform a basic network scan.
   - The scan revealed critical vulnerabilities, including recursive DNS, which allows for DNS poisoning.

4. **Remediation of Critical Vulnerabilities:**
   - Recursive DNS was disabled on the server to mitigate the risk of DNS poisoning.

## Usage
To replicate the process:
1. Deploy a Windows Server 2022 instance on AWS.
2. Enable Active Directory and DNS services on the server.
3. Use Nessus or similar vulnerability scanning tool to scan the server.
4. Identify and remediate critical vulnerabilities based on scan results.
