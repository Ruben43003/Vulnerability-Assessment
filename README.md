# Vulnerability Assessment - Windows Server 2022

## Purpose
This project demonstrates the process of analyzing the security posture of a Windows Server 2022 instance deployed on AWS. It involves enabling Active Directory and DNS services on the server, conducting vulnerability scanning using Nessus from a virtual Kali Linux machine, and remediating critical vulnerabilities identified in the scan results.

## Vulnerablity Management Process

1. **Deployment of Windows Server 2022 on AWS:** 
   - A Windows Server 2022 instance was deployed on AWS.
   - Configuration was left as default.

2. **Configuration of Active Directory and DNS Services:**
   - Active Directory and DNS services were enabled on the server.

3. **Vulnerability Scanning Using Nessus:**
   - Nessus was used from a virtual Kali Linux machine to perform a basic network scan.
   - The scan revealed critical vulnerabilities, including recursive DNS, which allows for DNS poisoning.

4. **Remediation of Critical Vulnerabilities:**
   - Recursive DNS was disabled on the server to mitigate the risk of DNS poisoning.

# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Vulnerability: DNS Recursive Query Cache Poisoning Weakness
### Risk Assessment:
- **CVSS Risk Score:** 5.0 (Medium)
- **Nessus Rating:** Medium

## Assessment Findings:
During the vulnerability assessment conducted using Nessus, it was identified that the DNS server had recursive DNS enabled. This vulnerability, with a CVSS risk score of 5.0 and a medium rating according to Nessus, posed a potential risk of DNS poisoning and could potentially allow attackers to manipulate DNS responses and redirect traffic to malicious sites.

## Remediation Actions:
To mitigate the risk associated with the recursive DNS vulnerability, the following actions were taken:
1. **Disable Recursive DNS:** Recursive DNS functionality was disabled on the DNS server. This prevents the server from recursively querying other DNS servers on behalf of clients, thus reducing the risk of DNS poisoning and unauthorized DNS resolution.

## Impact on Security:
Disabling recursive DNS on the server enhances the security posture of the DNS infrastructure by limiting the attack surface and reducing the risk of DNS-based attacks. By preventing recursive queries, the DNS server is no longer susceptible to DNS cache poisoning attacks, which could have resulted in unauthorized redirection of client traffic to malicious destinations.

  


## Usage
To replicate the process:
1. Deploy a Windows Server 2022 instance on AWS.
2. Enable Active Directory and DNS services on the server.
3. Use Nessus or similar vulnerability scanning tool to scan the server.
4. Identify and remediate critical vulnerabilities based on scan results.
